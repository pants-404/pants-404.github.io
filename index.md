 **Welcome to my github page!**

I hope you enjoy your stay! This page will be a work in progress throughout my journey through University of Oregon's OBA and CIT programs.
In the past I have helped set up other basic webpages for friends such as [golarp.com](http://golarp.com).

**Here is a complete list of projects I completed for CIT 281**

***Project 2***
[Prject 2](https://uo-cit.github.io/p2-17S-pants-404/) was a basic set up of a github project page


***Project 3***
[Project 3](https://uo-cit.github.io/p3-17s-pants-404/) centered around using apis for flickr and 500px in order to create an app that used an input to get search results for phots

***Project 4***
[Project 4](https://uo-cit.github.io/p4-17s-pants-404/) focused on adapting code from 500px app and using it with the unsplash api, and then using youtube's api to create an app that got search results for videos then displaying the results.
